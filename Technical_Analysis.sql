# Technical Analysis for Deliverable 1 and Deliverable 2

## Challenge to identify employees about to retire and employees eligible to participate in mentorship program.

As you are working with different data sets all containing data that at times over laps its important to review
the data and identify code solutions that will pull necessary data to provide the correct outcomes. This was one of the 
challenges identified, multiple data sets had overlapping information. As you are working to pull data the outcomes had
multiple duplicates and being able to filter the data that was pulled initially was also a challenge to ensure that the
correct data is processed. This challenge if not identified and rectified can also be a challenge in the success of the 
companies outcomes and strategic planning for the future.


## Challenges and solutions identified through data review process.

In identifying duplicates in gathering the data its as important to process the correct code that will filter the right 
outcomes. In the process of filtering data you might also loose valueable data that in the long run will impact future 
planning of staff needs for the company to continue to succeed. Also, identifying the employees that will be able to mentor 
others is essential in helping the company succeed in their strategic planning process. Initially filtering the data to 
include all employees that are retiring through joining different data sets provided outcomes that showed duplicate employees 
based on the positions they held, secondly identifying the correct number of retirees based on their most recent position through 
partitioning the data provided an accurate number of soon to retire employees. Thirdly identifying the total number of employees 
grouped by titles. Lastly, identifying the potential employees that qualify to mentor through inner joining different data sets
and partitioning the data to filter duplicates. These methods provided and accurate outcome and help the company succeed in 
planning for the future staff needs. 


## Results/Conclusion of data review.

In reviewing the outcomes the initial data analysis of filtering data of retirees provided an outcome of over 54K employees, 
as I filtered the data to exclude duplicate employees that held different positions through the years reduce the data to over 33K employees, 
and the last outcome of eligible mentors provided a number of over 1500 employees. This provides a big learning that the number of eligible 
mentors is relatively lower than the total amount of eligible retirees. This outcome can provide an opportunity to the success in the companys 
future staff needs as there may not be aneough mentors to be able to train new employees that will replace the positions of those retiring.
